# Upfiring

Upfiring is the first-ever decentralized P2P file-sharing platform. Our project is now open source, and anyone can contribute to development.

## Purpose

The main goal of this decentralized application is to enable users to directly exchange their files for cryptocurrency. This empowers users to set their own prices for their content and removes the middleman.
