# Upfire

Upfire is the first-ever decentralized P2P file-sharing platform on the Ethereum blockchain. This project is open source- anyone can contribute to development.

## Purpose

The main goal of this decentralized application is to enable users to directly exchange their files for cryptocurrency. This empowers users to set their own prices for their content and removes the middleman.

## Changes from Upfiring

Upfire will feature many changes from Upfiring, including using ETH for payments, the implementation of governance proposals, and staking.
